# UE4-Basic-shooting-

This Project is ran in UE 4.27.2

when the game is ran Press 1 to access the ray trace weapon and press 2 to access the ball weapon, also use WASD to move around the firing range
I was given an assingment at uni and also wanted to mess around with ue4 so i create a shooting range that i could fire 2 different weapons in.
i wanted to make sure the i didnt just a ball object that had gravity like a bullet i also wanted to implement raytracing and test the two different weapons with dynamic targets.

This is what the first weapon looks like, i wanted to weapons look slightly different so i used a colour pallet change to express this, as you can see i also implemented targets into this shooting range and a time counter and also an amount of hits made.

there was supposed to be more implementation like stopping once you have hit a certain amount of targets but i was to busy and this is maybe something i want to come back to.
